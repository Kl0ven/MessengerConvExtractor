# MessengerInfosExtractor

## Description

Extract data from messenger using "Download Your Information" (https://www.messenger.com/dyi/)

## How does it work

Set `message_filename` to your path of the conversation json file  and launch with `npm start`!

All results will be available in the Outputs folders, one file for each tasks.

## Tasks

- get_pseudo_list : get all the aliases every user ever had
- get_conv_names : get every name of the groupe
- get_numbers_of_msg_per_user : it speeks for itself
- get_most_reacted_message : again easy ;)
- hopefully more to come ðŸ˜…
