# MessengerInfosExtractor

## Description

Extract data from messenger using "Download Your Information" (https://www.messenger.com/dyi/)

## How does it work

Set `message_filename` to your path of the conversation json file  and launch with `npm start`!

All results will be available in the Outputs folders, one file for each tasks.

## Tasks

- getPseudoList : get all the aliases every user ever had
- getConvNames : get every name of the groupe
- getNumbersOfMsgPerUser : it speeks for itself
- getMostReactedMessage : again easy ;)
- getNumbersOfReactionPerUser 
- hopefully more to come ðŸ˜…
